# NumberTools #

A small collection of static Maths helper functions for [Haxe](http://haxe.org) and AS3.

I use this constantly. Hopefully somebody else finds it useful too!


## Usage ##

Haxe - Just dump the NumberTools.hx file in your source folder.

AS3 - NumberTools has been compiled into NumberTools.swc, it lives in the bin folder and can be imported into your AS3 projects.
