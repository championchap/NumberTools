# NumberTools #

A small collection of static Maths helper functions for [Haxe](http://haxe.org) and AS3.

I use this constantly. Hopefully somebody else finds it useful too!


## Usage ##

Haxe - Just dump the NumberTools.hx file in your source folder. Change the package to something like "utils" if you want to tidy it away somewhere. 

AS3 - NumberTools has been compiled into NumberTools.swc, it lives in the bin folder and can be imported into your AS3 projects.


## Requirements ##

Currently, NumberTools relies on a couple of Flash features, which means you won't be able to use it when targeting other platforms unless you're using [OpenFl](http://openfl.org). I will remove this dependency sooner or later. 

If you really want to use it anyway, it shouldn't be too dificult to make the changes yourself.
