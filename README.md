# NumberTools #

A small collection of static Maths helper functions written in 
[Haxe](http://haxe.org) but with exported libs also available for AS3 and JS. 


## Usage ##

Haxe - To install NumberTools run this command: 

```
haxelib git NumberTools https://github.com/championchap/NumberTools.git
```

AS3 - NumberTools has been compiled into NumberTools.swc, it lives in the bin 
	  directory and can be imported into your AS3 projects as normal. 

JS - NumberTools is available as a JS Library, you will find it named 
	 NumberTools.js in the bin directory. Use it in your JS apps as normal. 


## Requirements ##

Some NumberTools functionality currently requires access to Flash target stuff, 
or OpenFl stuff. The JS Lib for example is missing a little functionality. I 
will work on removing these dependencies soon.
